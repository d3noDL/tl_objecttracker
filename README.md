# OBJECT TRACKER TOOL
 
 - A small tool created for my project. Tracks the GameObjects you choose for easy access in huge hierarchies.
 - Options to: Add, Focus view in scene, remove and toggle active state
 - Simply open the tool by navigating ADG/Object tracker, click on an GameObject in the hierarchy and click "Add"
